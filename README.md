# practitioners-challenge

This repository contains our team's documents created for the Practitioners Challenge 2024 at LSE. We present a methodology and a corresponding model for forecasting credit default correlations for the Latin American and Caribbean region.

**Framework:** We estimate Dynamic Correlations using DCC & GJR-GARCH and train a DeepAR model with multiple time series to forecast correlations for any two company in the LAC region.
